## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Install DETR SDK
pip install rfdetr

# Install additional dependencies
pip install roboflow matplotlib opencv-python-headless

# Verify GPU availability (optional)
nvidia-smi
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Dataset Preparation

```python
from roboflow import Roboflow

# Initialize Roboflow with your API key
rf = Roboflow(api_key="your_api_key_here")
project = rf.workspace("workspace_name").project("project_name")
version = project.version(1)

# Download dataset in COCO format
dataset = version.download("coco")
```

### 2. Model Training

```python
from rfdetr import RFDETR

# Load pre-trained model
model = RFDETR.from_pretrained("detr-base")

# Fine-tune on your dataset
model.train(
    dataset_path=dataset.location,
    epochs=30,
    batch_size=4,  # Adjust based on GPU memory
    lr=0.0001
)
```

### 3. Inference

```python
# Load trained model
model = RFDETR.from_checkpoint("path/to/checkpoint.pth")

# Run inference
results = model.predict("path/to/image.jpg")
```
